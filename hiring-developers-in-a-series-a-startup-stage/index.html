  <h1>Hiring developers in a Series-A startup stage</h1>
  <p>After some time with this blog switched off, I’d like to switch it on again and write about hiring the right software developers to grow your technical team in a Series-A startup stage strongly. I want to share it through on my experience.</p>

<p>In my last executive position, I had the opportunity of co-founding a successful startup in Brazil. We built a digital lending platform called BankFacil since 2012 - now named as <a href="https://www.creditas.com.br">Creditas</a>. We grew up from five to over a hundred people in almost five years. Between 2015 and 2016, after we got a Series-A of investment, we scaled the company by nearly three times of size, from ~40 to ~100 in the whole startup and the product/technical team from ~10 to ~30. When you set up a business, you wear a lot of hats, and at that moment as CTO I spent way too much time hiring than another moment before. This year of 2017, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bankfacil">Creditas got a Series-B round</a>, and they are again growing and hiring.</p>

<p>I’m living in Melbourne / Australia, and I have been as tech advisor and angel investor at <a href="https://www.rapidoo.com.br">Rapidoo</a> since I left Creditas in August 2016. Rapidoo is a digital invoice factoring in Brazil and recently has been growing and hiring developers too.</p>

<h2 id="seeking-the-best-developer">Seeking the best developer</h2>

<p>At BankFacil I had talked to more than 1000 people in my last year, and we had hired 20 of them. It meant an average of four interviews per work day in 365 days. We got less than 2% of effectiveness at the end. We didn’t hire just software developers, but surely people as product managers, product designers, data engineers and data scientists.</p>

<p>We selected top professionals and set excellent teams. After some of many that interviews, we developed our interview process consolidated of five parts. Let’s talk about them for the software engineer interview process, as below:</p>

<h2 id="the-interview-process">The interview process</h2>

<h3 id="1-curriculum-filtering">1) Curriculum filtering</h3>

<p>We’d spread the job opportunities through many channels - this post won’t cover how we did it. Once the candidates filled in and sent the hiring application online to us, we quickly did a usual filter about their curriculum to remove the improper candidates till 48 hours. To the proper ones, we made contact and sent a code challenge. When they finished and sent it back, we analyzed and asked them for an interview physically.</p>

<h3 id="2-culture">2) Culture</h3>

<p>The most significant part of the process. Here we investigated the culture in general. Do our values match to the candidate’s values? We had a favorable environment and a nice office, and this package also held part of our culture to show to them. Other important questions we asked the candidates: Do you like reading? What is your dream? Why did you choose us? What is your hobby? What do you think about our business/mission? What are you passionate about? How was the team you are/were working on?</p>

<h3 id="3-tech-culture">3) Tech culture</h3>

<p>I could contribute to developing at BankFacil a robust technical culture based on open-source, a community spirit, mind about the maintenance of a quality software, an Agile development culture, and be conscious that the theory and the practice have both coming together while developing software. It was essential to attracting the right mindset professionals. We asked the candidates questions like: Have you gone to any community events? Have you read any relevant books recently? Have you ever contributed to open-source? Why did you choose this profession? What is a genuinely good team for you?</p>

<h3 id="4-technical-skills-questions">4) Technical skills questions</h3>

<p>Once the culture questions were all ok, we jumped them to here and asked questions about technical and team skills. I knew that what was important was “show me the code” rather than talking about coding, but we asked them about some situations like: “Could you draw your past best architecture on the board, please?”. That question was perfect to see their communication skills and to understand if they could or not explain things to us and express themselves well. The communication skill is completely crucial for small problem solver teams. If that guy can’t do that at least adequately, you will have a big problem. All of your team will get stressed in many situations while solving or understanding problems.</p>

<h3 id="5-pair-programming">5) Pair programming</h3>

<p>This step is the best part of the process :) We did it using the candidate’s result code challenge or a new one if they hadn’t got it to solve before. We asked them to refactor a feature or include some new. The pairing is so relevant that it shows us a lot of things about the candidates, like their ability, talent, knowledge, and smartness. Don’t miss it if you want to find the right developer for your team.</p>

<h2 id="how-was-all-of-it-organized">How was all of it organized?</h2>

<p>It’s important to mention we started this process from the ten product/technical people, in other words, we already had two senior lead developers to help on hiring when we began scaling, and after that, we found more three great lead developers.</p>

<p>The process between 2nd to 5th part took from 30 minutes to 3 hours of time. It depended on how many steps of the process a candidate had passed. The culture, tech culture and tech skill questions parts I did. The 1st part of analyzing the results of the code challenge and the 5th part of pair programming a lead developer did together with the candidate. As a way to disseminate the process to the team, from the 2nd to 4th part, a lead developer followed me. The Leonardo Andreucci was the CPO - now the current CTO of Creditas, he also followed me in the most of the time of the process.</p>

<p>In some cases depending on the seniority and position, the candidate was invited to have a talk with the CEO and other directors as a final part of the process.</p>

<h2 id="which-were-my-learnings">Which were my learnings?</h2>

<p>We had great benchmarks of in our team to compare the new hires, and we could seek on hiring better and different people to create winner teams. I prefer getting a professional with two-times act and one-time talent instead of the opposite. To be smart is fundamental.</p>

<p>Having followed those steps were crucial to us to find the best professionals for our context, size, and culture.</p>
